# You are spending too long making your game

Money/Hour spent optimization
 - Question: what about value based pricing?

## A casual hit
A high dollar/hour spent on the game itself (guessing this doesn't count past investment in engine)
 - kept a small scope
 - worked for the target audience
 - money spent on art (quality assets appealed to audience)
 - it was localized
 - 7th match 3 game (allowed him to work quicker & build off previous work)

Make a lot of smaller games rather than one bigger game:
> Roll a bunch of dice, not just one big die. 

## Shadowhand
His most recent 2 year long game project (shadowhand) didn't pay off nearly as well in dollars made per hour as some of his smaller match 3 titles. Jake says Shadowhand is definitely his best, most polished game, but thinks his dollar/hour metric proves this doesn't pay off. 

Reign in perfectionism in areas that players won't care about, focus on quality where the player cares.

Try shipping first chapter/season/base game before adding in additional content, like DLC after the game has proven worth.

## Ways to reduce dev time
 - Reuse engine
 - Don't make a 3D game
 - Get help from experts
    - Artists (audio & visual)
 - Keep a polish list
    - Keep any feature that is non essential on a secondary list
    - Does this item still feel important a week later?
    - If any customers comment on them after launch, fix it then
 - Be aware of wasting time
 - Build using inverted pyramid
    - Adam Saltsman 2016 GDC talk?
      - I think it's mentioned later on in [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYpHbuF08Mk)
    - build a small shippable piece, then keep building a bigger layer on top, where you can ship at any point on the pyramid
 - Productivity
    - Monitor it & try to improve your metrics

> Be Realistic
