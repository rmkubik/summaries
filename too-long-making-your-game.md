Money/Hour spent optimization
 - Question: what about value based pricing?

## A casual hit
A high dollar/hour spent on the game itself (guessing this doesn't count past investment in engine)
 - small scope
 - worked for audience
 - money spent on art
 - localized
 - 7th match 3 game

Make a lot of smaller games rather than one bigger game:
> Roll a bunch of dice, not just one big die. 

Reign in perfectionism in areas that players won't care about, focus on quality where the player cares.

Try shipping first chapter/season/base game before adding in additional content, like DLC after the game has proven worth.

## Ways to reduce dev time
 - Reuse engine
 - Don't make a 3D game
 - Get help from experts
    - Artists (audio & visual)
 - Keep a polish list
    - Keep any feature that is non essential on a secondary list
    - Does this item still feel important a week later?
    - If any customers comment on them after launch, fix it then
 - Be aware of wasting time
 - Build using inverted pyramid
    - Adam Saltsman 2016 GDC talk?
    - build a small shippable piece, then keep building a bigger layer on top, where you can ship at any point on the pyramid
 - Productivity
    - Monitor it & try to improve your metrics

> Be Realistic
