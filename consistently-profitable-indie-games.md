[Watch it on Youtube]()
by: Ryan Clark

## Hooks
- Include as many hooks/unique factors as possible.
- Compare the hooks of successful and poorly performing games similar to your own to see what good hooks are.

## Market Analysis
- look at games most similar to yours to get an idea what types of games are successful when you’ll be releasing. 
- Consider Market size and sale demographics. 
- Genres that include polyamorous gamers.
- Do sales estimates on those similar games (like on steamspy)

## Promotion: 
- Game design & promotion should go hand in hand, you need to be able to explain your game in a convincing and attractive way. 
- Give people a human angle. 
- Trailers are important to consider early (so should the rest of marketing)

## A good idea is/has:
- great hooks
- viable market
- easy to promote
- something you’re excited to make
- something you have skills and resources to make

He has some good examples for pretty much each of these points too.

The audio is messed up around 32 minutes though, I think it comes back around 36 mark.

> Come up with so many ideas that you find one you ‘want to make’ are ‘able to make’ and ‘will make enough money’. 

> Creativity is key, not funding.

> Cannot rely on being on Steam for your marketing

## Final Tips
Practice. 
Build a good team. 
Networking (AKA just make friends with people who are in games). 
Build up your reputation.
Put yourself out there at festivals/conventions. 
It takes time.
